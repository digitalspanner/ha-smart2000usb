![Smart Boat 2000 USB Integration](.github/smart2000.png)

The **ha-smart2000usb** integration lets **Home Assistant** receive live **NMEA 2000 (CAN bus)** data via a direct USB-CAN adapter. Plug it straight into your Raspberry Pi for a reliable, hard-wired data feed, perfect for permanent installations or when you need maximum stability. Stream engine data, tank levels, wind, depth, GPS, and other marine instruments directly into your Home Assistant dashboards.
